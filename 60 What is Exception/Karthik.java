 * 
 *    errors
 *      1.compile time error -- ex. System.out.Println(); here capital P is error in println these are example for compile time errors.
 *      2.run time error  -- these are seroius errors we need to handle it so,
 *              exception handling is here.  ex.if we created a application for flight then that applictaion crashes during take off means think so runtime errors are very serious and we need to take care of it .
 *                                           ex. think of medical scanning softwares also, it should handle exception without stoping or crashing the code running.
 * 
 *      3.Logical errors -- it is normal for making mistakes in entering mathematical symbols.
 *                          ex.our expected output is 10 but if system gives 15 it is a bug the logic is some where error.
