/*
 * reference variable, new keyword and object in java
 *   -->when you use new in Java, it creates a new object on the heap, 
 *      and the reference variable you use to store the object points to that 
 *      object in memory. The reference variable is not the object itself; it's 
 *      a way to access and manipulate the object's data and behavior. 
 *      Multiple reference variables can refer to the same object, and changes made 
 *      through any of them affect the underlying object because they all point to it.
