/*
 * In Java, you cannot directly assign a super class object to a subclass reference 
 * variable because it violates the fundamental principle of object-oriented programming 
 * called the "Liskov Substitution Principle" (LSP). The Liskov Substitution Principle states 
 * that objects of a subclass should be able to replace objects of the superclass without 
 * affecting the correctness of the program.
 * 
 * 
 * If you were allowed to assign a superclass object to a subclass reference variable, 
 * you would potentially run into issues because the subclass may have additional fields, 
 * methods, or behaviors that the superclass does not have. Attempting to access these 
 * subclass-specific features using the superclass reference variable would lead to 
 * runtime errors or unexpected behavior.
